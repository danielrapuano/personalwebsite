        <h4 class="card-title">A Brief Summary of Me</h4>
        <p class="card-text mt-3">
          Computer science and human psychology are the apex of modern business. I understood this early on, now having degrees in both. I graduated
          in 2017 from the University of Connecticut with a BA in Psychological Sciences, and in 2024 from the Southern Connecticut State University
          with a BS in Computer Science.  Throughout my education, when I wasn't studying, I was almost always working.  These jobs may have been 
          menial, such as being a cook, or a cashier, but they taught me how to work under stress with a team efficeintly, as well as how to work with customers.
          </p>

          <p class ="card-text">
          My education and experience have given me skills through accredited psychological research, application design and development
          including usability testing with a focus on UX, front-end and back-end development utilizing technologies such as HTML, Bootstrap, 
          Tailwind, JavaScript, React, and more.  Futhermore, I have experience with various design tools including Figma and Adobe Creative Suite.
          My mix of both psychological and technical knowledge allows me to fully understand, and execute the application design process from start to finish,
          with a focus on how the user will interact with the product.
          </p>

          <p class ="card-text">
          I strongly believe as technology continues to permeate our lives, and as we become increasingly reliant on it, the need for a human-centered approach to design is paramount.
          I am passionate about creating products that are not only functional but also enjoyable and natural to use. I strive to create designs that are intuitive, accessible, and engaging.
